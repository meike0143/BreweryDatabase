# Brewery Database Website
Welcome to Brewery database! Here you can learn all about every brewery. Their cities, country and brewery types are esprecially helpful.
**You can access the deployed version on:** https://meike0143.github.io/BreweryDatabase/

## API Choice
With my previous, originally approved API I ran into CORS issues, which after trying many things I still couldnâ€™t manage to resolve. Upon using another API for the assignment, it worked very well immediately. For this reason I have opted to use this other API for the assignment. 

**You can find this API at:** https://www.openbrewerydb.org/
